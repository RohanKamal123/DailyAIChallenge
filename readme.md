# Daily AI Project Challenge
A journey to build AI projects to land a dream job in AI/ML. Iâ€™m a 2nd-year BSDS student at UIU, coding daily to grow my skills!

## Projects
1. **Transformer from Scratch** (Completed)
   - Built a Transformer in PyTorch with attention heatmap.
   - [Details](TransformerProject/README.md)
   - Output: `torch.Size([8, 8, 1000])`, `attention_heatmap.png`

## Upcoming
### TIER 1: Foundation (Build First)
1. **Multi-Modal RAG System**: Build a retrieval-augmented generation system combining text and images.
2. **LLM Fine-tuning Pipeline**: Create a pipeline to fine-tune a small language model (e.g., DistilBERT).
3. **Real-Time ML Pipeline with MLOps**: Implement a real-time prediction pipeline with CI/CD and monitoring.
4. **Multi-Agent AI System**: Develop a system with multiple AI agents collaborating on tasks.

### TIER 2: Business Applications
5. **AI-Powered Code Review Assistant**: Automate code reviews with AI suggestions.
6. **Smart Resume-Job Matching Engine**: Match resumes to job descriptions using NLP.
7. **Financial News Analysis & Trading Signals**: Analyze news for stock trading signals.
8. **AI Customer Support with Escalation Logic**: Build a chatbot with human escalation.
9. **Document Intelligence Platform**: Extract insights from documents using NLP and OCR.
10. **AI Content Moderation System**: Detect inappropriate content in text/images.
11. **Predictive Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize predictions with Streamlit/Plotly.

### TIER 3: Advanced Showcase
